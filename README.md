# AI-Broker: Intelligent Freight Brokerage Automation Platform üööü§ñ

AI-Broker is a web-based platform that automates freight brokerage operations for independent brokers, enabling them to handle 3-5x more loads while maintaining quality and compliance. The platform uses AI agents that communicate through multiple channels (email, SMS, phone) on behalf of brokers, managing the entire freight lifecycle from quoting through payment.

## üèóÔ∏è Documentation-Driven Development

This project uses a comprehensive documentation system to facilitate effective human-AI collaboration in software development. All development decisions are guided by four core context files that work together to ensure technical implementation aligns with business requirements and industry best practices.

    

## üìã Core Context Files

- External requirements (API keys, accounts, configurations)
- Code examples and database schemas
- Testing strategies and production checklists

**When to Reference**:
- Starting work on any new feature
- Planning sprint or weekly tasks
- Understanding current development phase
- Setting up external integrations
- Preparing for production deployment

### PRD.md - Product Requirements Document

- Validating feature completeness

### ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical Architecture & System Design
**Purpose**: Defines how we build the platform. Provides technical patterns, design principles, and implementation guidelines.

**Contents**:
- System architecture and component design
- Multi-channel communication strategy
- AI agent coordination and workflows
- Data architecture and models
- Performance optimization strategies
- Development best practices
- Scalability and continuous improvement frameworks

**When to Reference**:
- Writing any code
- Making technical architecture decisions
- Setting up integrations
- Optimizing performance
- Designing new components

### FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md - Industry Context & Business Logic
**Purpose**: Provides deep freight industry knowledge to ensure our technical solutions address real business problems correctly.

**Contents**:
- Complete freight brokerage process flows
- Industry terminology and stakeholder relationships
- Freight type variations (FTL, LTL, Reefer, Flatbed, Hazmat)
- Regulatory environment and compliance requirements
- Pain points and automation opportunities
- Current industry technology landscape

**When to Reference**:
- Implementing business logic
- Handling industry-specific edge cases
- Making decisions about freight processes
- Understanding user workflows
- Designing automation features

## üîÑ How They Work Together

### Development Workflow
```
1. DEV_PLAN.md ‚Üí What am I building this week?
2. PRD.md ‚Üí What are the exact requirements?
3. ARCHITECTURE.md ‚Üí How should I implement this?
4. FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md ‚Üí What industry rules apply?
5. Implement with comprehensive documentation references
6. Update context files if new insights are discovered
```

### Decision-Making Hierarchy
1. **Business Requirements** (PRD.md) - What the product must do
2. **Industry Context** (FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md) - How the freight industry works
3. **Technical Architecture** (ARCHITECTURE.md) - How to implement it correctly
4. **Development Plan** (DEV_PLAN.md) - When and how to build it

### Quality Assurance
Every code commit must:
- Reference specific sections from relevant context files
- Include business context from FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md
- Follow patterns defined in ARCHITECTURE.md  
- Meet requirements specified in PRD.md
- Align with current phase in DEV_PLAN.md

## ü§ñ Human-AI Collaboration Model

### AI Responsibilities
- **Context Consultation**: Always check relevant documentation before implementation
- **Pattern Following**: Implement according to architectural guidelines
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep context files current as development progresses
- **Question Surfacing**: Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear

### Human Responsibilities
- **Strategic Decisions**: Business priorities, feature scope, timeline adjustments
- **Industry Expertise**: Freight brokerage process clarifications and edge cases
- **External Setup**: API keys, accounts, third-party service configurations
- **Quality Review**: Testing, user feedback, performance validation

### Collaboration Principles
1. **Transparency**: All decisions are documented and traceable
2. **Context-Driven**: No implementation without proper context consultation
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Documentation evolves with implementation learning
4. **Question-Friendly**: Ambiguity is surfaced immediately, not assumed

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Read CLAUDE.md for complete development workflow
2. Review DEV_PLAN.md to understand current phase
3. Study PRD.md for feature requirements  
4. Understand ARCHITECTURE.md patterns
5. Familiarize with FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md industry context

### For Business Stakeholders
1. PRD.md provides complete product vision and requirements
2. DEV_PLAN.md shows development timeline and milestones
3. ARCHITECTURE.md explains technical approach and scalability
4. FREIGHT_BROKERAGE.md validates industry alignment
