# AI-Broker Architecture & Foundation

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive architecture and foundation for AI-Broker v1, starting with an MVP focused on automating FTL dry van freight quoting and expanding strategically to maximize value delivery and speed to market.

## Strategic Analysis: Post-MVP Direction

### Option 1: Expand Freight Types (Recommended) âœ…

**Advantages:**
- **Immediate Market Expansion**: Each freight type adds 15-25% more addressable market
- **Faster Revenue Growth**: Brokers can use the tool for more of their business immediately
- **Lower Technical Risk**: Quoting is a well-bounded problem across freight types
- **Proven Value Delivery**: MVP success in FTL validates the quoting automation value prop
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each freight type adds manageable complexity
- **Network Effects**: More freight types = more carrier data = better pricing intelligence

**Implementation Approach:**
1. LTL (Week 5-6): Most different from FTL, highest value add
2. Refrigerated (Week 7): Minor modifications to FTL logic
3. Flatbed (Week 8): Adds permit complexity but similar flow
4. Partial/Volume (Week 9): Hybrid of FTL/LTL logic

### Option 2: End-to-End FTL Automation

**Advantages:**
- Complete automation for one freight type
- Deeper value for FTL-only brokers
- Full platform demonstration

**Disadvantages:**
- **Longer Time to Broad Value**: 8-10 weeks vs 4-5 weeks
- **Higher Technical Risk**: Each stage (dispatch, tracking, billing) has unique challenges
- **Smaller Initial Market**: Only helps with FTL loads
- **Complex Integration Requirements**: GPS tracking, document processing, payment systems

### Recommendation: Option 1 - Expand Freight Types First

**Rationale:**
1. **Speed to Value**: Delivers usable features every 1-2 weeks vs every 2-3 weeks
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Quoting is proven; other stages have unknown complexities
3. **Customer Feedback**: Learn what matters most before building deep
4. **Revenue Acceleration**: Brokers pay more for tools that handle all freight
5. **Competitive Advantage**: No competitor handles all freight types intelligently

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Agent System Architecture
- **Unified Intake Agent**: Processes all incoming quote requests
- **Classification Agents**: Specialized for each freight type
- **Pricing Engines**: Market-aware rate calculation
- **Communication Agents**: Multi-channel delivery

### 2. Data Architecture
```sql
-- Core tables structure
- brokers: Company and user management
- loads: All shipment records
- quotes: Generated quotes and carrier responses
- communications: All inbound/outbound messages
- carriers: Carrier database with performance metrics
- invoices: Billing and payment records
```

### 3. Integration Architecture
- **Email**: OAuth-based (Gmail, Outlook) + IMAP fallback
- **Documents**: Reducto for OCR/document processing
- **AI Services**: OpenAI primary, Anthropic backup
- **Communications**: Resend for email, Twilio for SMS
- **Payments**: Stripe for processing
- **Analytics**: PostHog for product, custom for business

### 4. Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with magic links
- **Authorization**: Row-level security on all tables
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, API keys, CORS
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **AI/ML**: LangChain + OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Queue**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Charts**: Recharts

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + OpenTelemetry
- **Analytics**: PostHog + Custom Metrics
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Vercel Deploy

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each freight type is a self-contained module that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### 2. Scalability
Serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling without infrastructure management.

### 3. Reliability
Multiple fallback mechanisms for critical services (AI providers, communication channels).

### 4. Extensibility
Plugin architecture allows easy addition of new freight types, carriers, and integrations.

### 5. Security First
All data encrypted, comprehensive audit logging, principle of least privilege.

## Development Philosophy

### Rapid Iteration
- Ship features every 1-2 weeks
- Get customer feedback early and often
- Measure everything, optimize based on data

### Quality Standards
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Code review for all changes
- Automated testing and deployment

### Customer Focus
- Build what brokers actually need
- Prioritize based on revenue impact
- White-glove onboarding for early customers

## Success Factors

1. **Speed**: Ship features every 1-2 weeks
2. **Focus**: Start with quoting, expand intelligently
3. **Quality**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
4. **Feedback**: Continuous customer input
5. **Iteration**: Rapid improvements based on data
