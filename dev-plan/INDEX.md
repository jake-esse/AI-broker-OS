## Development Strategy
The recommended approach is to expand freight types (Option 1) before building end-to-end automation, based on:
- **Speed to Value**: Delivers usable features every 1-2 weeks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Quoting is proven; other stages have unknown complexities
- **Customer Feedback**: Learn what matters most before building deep
- **Revenue Acceleration**: Brokers pay more for tools that handle all their freight
- **Competitive Advantage**: No competitor handles all freight types intelligently

## Current Status
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 (MVP)
- **Current Week**: Week 3
- **Overall Progress**: 8% Complete (2 of 24 weeks)
- **Next Milestone**: Web application foundation and quote interface

## Notes
- All dates are target dates and may be adjusted based on development progress
- Each week's detailed plan includes technical specifications, code examples, and implementation notes
