**Integration with Technical Architecture:**
This business process documentation directly informs the technical decisions in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and guides the implementation of automation features throughout the system.

## Industry Overview

### What is Freight Brokerage?

In the United States, a **freight broker** acts as the intermediary between a **shipper** (who needs to move cargo) and a **carrier** (who transports the cargo). The broker's job is to manage the entire shipment lifecycle from quoting a load to ensuring it's delivered, handling all communication and paperwork in between.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Shippers get access to a network of qualified carriers without managing relationships directly
- Carriers get consistent load opportunities without extensive sales efforts
- Brokers earn profit margin by efficiently matching supply and demand

**Business Model:**
Brokers typically charge shippers $X and pay carriers $Y, keeping the difference ($X - $Y) as their margin. Success depends on volume, efficiency, and relationship management.

### Industry Stakeholders

**1. Shippers (Customers)**
- Manufacturers, distributors, retailers who need to move products
- Generate load tenders (requests for transportation)
- Pay freight charges and expect reliable service
- Examples: Amazon, Walmart, local manufacturers

**2. Carriers (Service Providers)**
- Trucking companies with drivers and equipment
- Range from owner-operators (1 truck) to large fleets (1000+ trucks)
- Provide transportation capacity and equipment
- Get paid for moving freight safely and on time

**3. Brokers (Intermediaries)**
- Licensed entities that arrange transportation
- Must have DOT authority and proper insurance
- Range from solo operations to large firms like C.H. Robinson
- Generate revenue through margin between shipper payment and carrier cost

**4. Supporting Players**
- Load boards (DAT, Truckstop.com) for finding loads/trucks
- Factoring companies for carrier financing
- Insurance providers for cargo and liability coverage
- Technology providers for TMS, tracking, and automation

## Complete Freight Brokerage Process

### Universal Load Lifecycle (All Freight Types)

Every freight transaction follows this basic pattern, with variations based on freight type:

1. **Load Tender Receipt** - Shipper requests transportation
2. **Quote Development** - Broker prices the service  
3. **Carrier Sourcing** - Find qualified truck/driver
4. **Rate Negotiation** - Agree on carrier payment
5. **Load Confirmation** - Document the agreement
6. **Dispatch & Pickup** - Execute the pickup
7. **In-Transit Management** - Monitor progress
8. **Delivery Execution** - Complete the delivery
9. **Documentation & Billing** - Process paperwork and payments

**AI Automation Opportunities:** Each step contains manual processes that can be partially or fully automated while maintaining human oversight for exceptions.

## Detailed Process Flows by Freight Type

### Full Truckload (FTL) Freight Process

**Definition:** Full Truckload refers to shipments that fill an entire trailer (typically 48' or 53'), usually dedicated to one shipper's cargo.

#### 1. Receiving Load Details

**Service Options:**
1. **Volume LTL:** Large shipment through LTL network
2. **Shared Truckload:** Multiple partials on one truck
3. **Dedicated Partial:** Partial load with direct routing

#### PTL Process Variations:
