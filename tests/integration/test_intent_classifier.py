AI-Broker MVP · Email Intent Classifier Test Suite

OVERVIEW:
This test suite validates the email intent classification system to ensure
accurate identification of freight load tenders versus other email types.
It tests various email scenarios including edge cases and ambiguous content.

WORKFLOW:
1. Define test cases covering all email intent categories
2. Run classification on each test case
3. Validate classification accuracy and confidence scores
4. Display comprehensive results and metrics
5. Identify any misclassifications for improvement

BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Tests real-world email patterns from freight industry
- Validates confidence threshold compliance with ARCHITECTURE.md
- Ensures non-load emails are properly filtered
- Verifies edge case handling and fallback behavior

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Standalone test script with no external dependencies
- Uses production classifier with test data
- Comprehensive result analysis and reporting
- Performance metrics for classification speed

DEPENDENCIES:
- Local module: email_intent_classifier
- No external API calls required for testing
- Uses same LLM configuration as production
