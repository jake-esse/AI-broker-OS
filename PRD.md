# Product Requirements Document: AI-Broker MVP

## Executive Summary

AI-Broker is a web-based AI platform that automates freight brokerage operations for independent brokers, enabling them to handle 3-5x more loads while maintaining quality and compliance. The platform consists of a Next.js web application that serves as the broker's central command center, with AI agents that autonomously communicate through multiple channels (email, SMS, phone) on the broker's behalf. The system manages the entire freight lifecycle from shipper prospecting through payment, with intelligent human-in-the-loop escalation for low-confidence decisions.

## Problem Definition

### Industry Context
The U.S. freight brokerage industry consists of ~17,000 small firms, many of which are single-person operations. These independent brokers:
- Manage everything through phone, email, SMS, and spreadsheets
- Lack access to enterprise-grade technology solutions
- Spend 80% of their time on manual, repetitive tasks
- Are limited by human capacity to ~20-50 loads per month
- Face increasing pressure from tech-enabled competitors

### Core Problem
Independent freight brokers perform primarily information and relationship-based work that is highly suitable for AI automation. The manual nature of their operations creates:
- **Capacity Constraints:** Limited by hours in the day and cognitive load
- **Error Risk:** Manual data entry and communication leads to mistakes
- **Response Delays:** Slow quote turnaround loses business to faster competitors
- **Scale Limitations:** Cannot grow without proportional overhead increases
- **Market Disadvantage:** Cannot compete with technology-enabled large brokerages

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build an AI-powered platform that acts as an intelligent assistant to independent freight brokers, automating routine tasks while preserving broker control over relationships and critical decisions. The MVP focuses on automating FTL dry van quoting, with rapid expansion to all freight types post-launch.

### Success Metrics
- **Operational Efficiency:** 3-5x increase in loads handled per broker per month
- **Response Time:** <5 minute automated response to load tenders (vs. hours manually)
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ accuracy in data extraction and processing
- **User Adoption:** Week-over-week growth in active brokers
- **Revenue Impact:** 20-30% improvement in gross margins through efficiency

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Democratize Technology:** Give independent brokers enterprise-level capabilities
2. **Preserve Human Value:** Augment rather than replace broker expertise
3. **Build Network Effects:** Create platform value that increases with scale
4. **Enable Growth:** Allow brokers to scale without proportional cost increases

- Proactive requests for human guidance when uncertain
- Clear explanation of what input is needed and why
- Learning from broker responses to improve over time

**Load-Specific Conversations:**
- Each load has its own persistent chat thread
- AI maintains full context of load history
- References previous decisions and communications
- Surfaces relevant information proactively
- Suggests next best actions based on load status

- "Check in with the driver on this load"
- "Follow up with shipper about the missing BOL"
- "Find a backup carrier at a lower rate"
- "Send the invoice to accounting"
- "What's the profit margin on this load?"
- "Why did you quote this rate?"

**Proactive AI Communications:**
- "The driver hasn't checked in for 4 hours. Should I call them?"
- "This carrier's insurance expires tomorrow. I need to find an alternative."
- "The shipper usually pays within 30 days. It's been 35. Shall I send a reminder?"
- "Market rates on this lane have dropped 10%. Should I requote?"

**Context-Aware Responses:**
- AI understands the current load status and history
- References specific emails, documents, and prior conversations
- Maintains awareness of broker preferences and patterns
- Adapts communication style to urgency and importance

**Human Guidance Requests:**
- "I'm not confident about this carrier's safety rating (65%). Do you want to proceed?"
- "The shipper is asking for a 20% discount. This would put us below margin. Your call?"
- "I couldn't extract the delivery date from this email. What date should I use?"
- "This is a new lane for us. I suggest $2,500 but need your approval."
